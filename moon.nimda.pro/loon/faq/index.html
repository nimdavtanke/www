              Basic
            </h3>
            <h4>
              What are Project Loon balloons?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Project Loon is a global network of high altitude balloons. The balloons ascend like
              weather balloons until they reach the stratosphere, where they drift higher than 18
              km (60,000 ft), safely above the altitudes used for aviation. While weather balloons
              burst after only a few hours in the air, Loon balloons are superpressure, allowing
              them to last much longer. Loon balloons are also unique in that they can <a href=
              "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaY_1_2UBas">ride the wind</a> to travel where they
              need to go, they can coordinate with other balloons to <a href=
              "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjyLynnQuC4">provide stable coverage</a> on the
              ground, and their electronics are entirely solar powered.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How do I receive Internet service from the balloons?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Signals are transmitted from the balloons to a specialized <a href=
              "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpu0VZFKm5U">Internet antenna</a> <a href=
              "https://plus.google.com/photos/+ProjectLoon/albums/5889536317820400785/5889536592727172738">
              mounted to the side of a home or workplace</a>, or directly to LTE-enabled devices.
              Web traffic that travels through the balloon network is ultimately relayed to our
              local telecommunications partners’ ground stations, where it connects to pre-existing
              Internet infrastructure.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How high do the balloons fly?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We are flying in the stratosphere well above commercial air traffic and weather
              events, at around 18 - 27 km or 60,000 - 90,000 feet.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How long will a balloon stay up in the air?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We’re working on creating <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zULbu1xfdwE">a
              balloon design that can reliably last</a> for 100+ days at a time in the
              stratosphere. During our initial tests, flight durations will be shorter.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How will the balloons come down?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We control the balloons by <a href=
              "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4D0c6yQftc">raising and lowering them</a> to an
              altitude with winds blowing in the desired direction of travel. We plan to take our
              balloons down over preselected, safe recovery zones so we can easily collect them to
              reuse and recycle their parts. In the event of an unexpected landing, every Loon
              balloon is equipped with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y5AUHw8pRk">a
              parachute</a> to slow its descent.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How do you collect the balloons after they have landed?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The Project Loon team includes several recovery specialists who track down and
              collect landed balloons. We track our balloons continuously in the air using GPS and
              we take note of their location when they land. Once the landing location is known,
              the recovery team will be on their way. Ultimately, we plan to land the balloons in
              various collection points around the world.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Is there risk of airplanes hitting the balloons?
            </h4>
            <p>
              At their floating altitude, Loon balloons fly almost twice as high as commercial
              jetliners, so they are well out of the way. We coordinate with local air-traffic
              control when balloons are launched and when they descend.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Is it possible to see the balloons from the ground?
            </h4>
            <p>
              In certain weather conditions it may be possible to see a Loon balloon from the
              ground. Most of the time they will be very difficult to see with the naked eye.
            </p>
            <h4>
              I’m interested in partnering with Project Loon. How can I participate?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We’re looking for partners who can help us iterate on the technology and connect with
              local communities. Please fill out <a href=
              "https://services.google.com/fb/forms/loonpartnerships/">this form</a>, and we’ll be
              in touch if there is an opportunity to work together. In the meantime, you can follow
              the latest happenings with Project Loon on our <a href=

            <h3>
              Pilot test
            </h3>
            <h4>
              Where has Project Loon conducted pilot tests?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Project Loon began with a pilot test in June 2013, when thirty balloons were launched
              from New Zealand’s South Island and beamed Internet to a small group of pilot
              testers. The pilot test has since expanded to include a greater number of people over
              a wider area including California’s Central Valley, and a connectivity test in
              Northeast Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, Project Loon will continue to expand testing around the world
              throughout 2014.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Do you need permission to fly these balloons?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The laws applicable to high altitude balloon flight and telecommunications services
              differ from country to country, and we will comply with all applicable laws as
              required. There’s a precedent for this: approximately 70,000 weather balloons are
              launched per year.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What happens if a balloon lands in water?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We intend to avoid water landings, but when we make a controlled landing in the water
              there will be some extra gas in the balloon that will act as a flotation device and
              make the balloon easier to find and retrieve.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What steps is Project Loon taking to be environmentally responsible?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We are taking several steps to ensure Project Loon is environmentally responsible:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We’re working to guide all balloons to collection points upon descent, so we can
              reuse, recycle, or responsibly dispose of their parts.
              </li>
              <li>When balloons do not make it to one of these collection points, we send our
              recovery team out to collect them.
              </li>
              <li>Our balloons’ electronics are entirely solar powered.
              </li>
              <li>We are working to make our stratospheric wind data available to the environmental
              science community so it can be used to improve weather and climate models.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
              When do you expect the service to be available?
            </h4>
            <p>
              It’s too early to say; we’ve learned a lot in our ongoing New Zealand tests and in
              our Central Valley research flights and Brazil test. We’re using those learnings to
              refine the technology and improve the Loon system.

            <h3>
              Technology
            </h3>
            <h4>
              How do you deal with the extreme conditions in the stratosphere?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Situated on the edge of space, between 10 km and 60 km in altitude, the stratosphere
              presents unique engineering challenges: air pressure is 1% that at sea level, and
              this thin atmosphere offers less protection from UV radiation and dramatic
              temperature swings. By carefully designing the balloon envelope to withstand these
              conditions, Project Loon is able to take advantage of the stratosphere’s steady winds
              and remain well above weather events, wildlife and airplanes.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What electronics are on the balloon?
            </h4>
            <p>
              In addition to the specialized radios that provide Internet service to users on the
              ground, Loon balloons carry instruments to monitor the weather and ambient
              environmental conditions, as well as GPS units to keep track of their flight
              patterns. The electronics are powered by solar panels, and excess power is stored in
              a rechargeable battery so service can continue through the night.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What communication equipment is on a balloon?
            </h4>
            <p>
              There are two main radio transceivers on each balloon: a broad-coverage LTE base
              station (or “eNodeB”), and a high-speed directional link used to connect back to the
              Internet. There is also a third backup radio that can be used to communicate with the
              balloons from the ground if the others fail or go out of range.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Will the balloons have cameras or capture any imagery of the ground?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We use cameras on some of our test flights to observe how various components of the
              balloon are functioning, but our production balloons will not be equipped with
              downward-facing cameras.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How fast is balloon-powered Internet?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We expect Internet speeds to be comparable to 3G.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How does the Loon network interact with LTE networks?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Project Loon plans to partner with telecommunications companies in each country we
              operate in to share and coordinate use of LTE spectrum. Frequency bands that are
              difficult to use for broad coverage from terrestrial towers are great for balloon
              coverage.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How many people can one balloon serve?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Each balloon can provide coverage to a ground area about 40 km in diameter, and
              hundreds of people can connect to each balloon at once.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How are the balloons powered?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The equipment on the balloons is charged using solar panels during the day and a
              rechargeable battery during the night.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What kind of spectrum will be used?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Loon partners with telcos to utilize spectrum acquired in the local region.
            </p>
            <h4>
              How do you preserve the security and integrity of data transmitted over the Loon
              network?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Data is automatically encrypted while transiting the balloon network. In addition,
              only devices with specially provisioned Loon SIM cards can access the network. In the
              future we will integrate with the core networks of partners so data transmitted will
              have the same levels of encryption and authentication as those networks.
            </p>

              How is the movement of these balloons controlled?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The positioning of the Loon fleet is adjusted and controlled from Loon Mission
              Control, using a combination of automatic planning and human oversight. In addition,
              the individual balloon vehicles perform some automatic flight control functions, such
              as venting gas to prevent a burst or parachute deployment in case the balloon
              descends too quickly.
