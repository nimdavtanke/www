        How we hire
      </h1>
      <p>
        We’re looking for our next Noogler - someone who’s good for the role, good for Google and
        good at lots of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things move quickly around here. At Internet speed. That means we have to be nimble, both
        in how we work and how we hire. We look for people who are great at lots of things, love
        big challenges and welcome big changes. We can’t have too many specialists in just one
        particular area. We’re looking for people who are good for Google—and not just for right
        now, but for the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the core of how we hire. Our process is pretty basic; the path to getting hired
        usually involves a first conversation with a recruiter, a phone interview and an onsite
        interview at one of our offices. But there are a few things we’ve baked in along the way
        that make getting hired at Google a little different.
      </p>
      <div class="jobs-hiring-interview">
        <h2>
          How we interview
        </h2>
        <p>
          We’re looking for smart, team-oriented people who can get things done. When you interview
          at Google, you’ll likely interview with four or five Googlers. They’re looking for four
          things:
        </p>
        <div class="first">
          <h3>
            Leadership
          </h3>
          <p>
            We’ll want to know how you’ve flexed different muscles in different situations in order
            to mobilize a team. This might be by asserting a leadership role at work or with an
            organization, or by helping a team succeed when you weren’t officially appointed as the
            leader.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            Role-Related Knowledge
          </h3>
          <p>
            We’re looking for people who have a variety of strengths and passions, not just
            isolated skill sets. We also want to make sure that you have the experience and the
            background that will set you up for success in your role. For engineering candidates in
            particular, we’ll be looking to check out your coding skills and technical areas of
            expertise.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            How You Think
          </h3>
          <p>
            We’re less concerned about grades and transcripts and more interested in how you think.
            We’re likely to ask you some role-related questions that provide insight into how you
            solve problems. Show us how you would tackle the problem presented--don’t get hung up
            on nailing the “right” answer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            Googleyness
          </h3>
          <p>
            We want to get a feel for what makes you, well, you. We also want to make sure this is
            a place you’ll thrive, so we’ll be looking for signs around your comfort with
            ambiguity, your bias to action and your collaborative nature.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="jobs-hiring-decide">
        <h2>
          How we decide
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are also a few other things we do to make sure we’re always hiring the right
          candidate for the right role and for Google.
        </p>
        <div class="first">
          <h3>
            We collect feedback from multiple Googlers
          </h3>
          <p>
            At Google, you work on tons of projects with different groups of Googlers, across many
            teams and time zones. To give you a sense of what working here is really like, some of
            your interviewers could be potential teammates, but some interviewers will be with
            other teams. This helps us see how you might collaborate and fit in at Google overall.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            Independent committees of Googlers help us ensure we’re hiring for the long term
          </h3>
          <p>
            An independent committee of Googlers review feedback from all of the interviewers. This
            committee is responsible for ensuring our hiring process is fair and that we’re holding
            true to our “good for Google” standards as we grow.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We believe that if you hire great people and involve them intensively in the hiring
        process, you’ll get more great people. Over the past couple of years, we’ve spent a lot of
        time making our hiring process as efficient as possible - reducing time-to-hire and
        increasing our communications to candidates. While involving Googlers in our process does
        take longer, we believe it’s worth it. Our early Googlers identified these principles more
        than ten years ago, and it’s what allows us to hold true to who we are as we grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        These core principles are true across Google, but when it comes to specifics, there are
        some pieces of our process that look a little different across teams. Our recruiters can
        help you navigate through these as the time comes.
      </p>
      <div class="jobs-hiring-disclaimer">
        <p>
          At Google, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it, we support it, and we
          thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. Google is
          proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.
