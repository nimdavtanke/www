          Steel City? More like Tech City, these days. Google Pittsburgh's engineers and product
          managers have worked on Search, Ads, and Ads-Shopping products used by hundreds of
          millions of people, as well as core engineering infrastructure. And unlike some U.S.
          technology hubs, our city is both culturally rich and exceptionally livable.

              Want to tackle complex problems and build products used by hundreds of millions of
              people? At Google Pittsburgh, we’re helping shape some of Google’s most important
              engineering initiatives, from Shopping to Search to <a href=
              "https://plus.google.com/u/1/104629412415657030658/posts?gpsrc=hpjob">Android</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Engineers and Product Managers are experts in computer systems, networking,
              machine learning, computer vision and route planning. We’re working on projects that
              involve everything from intense parallel computing and massively-scaled systems
              infrastructure to system design and UI implementation. You can see our work
              throughout products like AdSense, AdWords and Google Shopping.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're also building up a Shopping Operations Team to help power the complex ecosystem
              across Sales, Product and Partners that makes Google's shopping products work. Our
              team glues together the feeds of products and offerings from online retailers with
              the high-quality descriptions and images, so you can search over 300 million
              products.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re located in a renovated Nabisco factory in Bakery Square, a mixed-use space in
              East Liberty, just minutes from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon. We believe we’re the
              perfect size for a Google office–big enough to drive major projects, but small enough
              that everyone knows everyone else. And, our replica Kennywood Amusement Park roller
              coaster car and murals of iconic local scenes give us a distinctly Steel City feel.

            Google Pittsburgh: Frequently Asked Questions
          </h2>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            Isn’t Pittsburgh an industrial city?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Only in old books and movies. Back in the day, this was a steel town, known for its
            smokestacks and smelters. Today, it’s a technology hotbed, a model for cities trying to
            transition from an industrial past to a knowledge-based future. Home to Carnegie Mellon
            and the University of Pittsburgh, the ’Burgh produces some of the finest engineering
            talent in the world. It’s also one of the most livable places in the U.S. Don’t take
            our word for it, though. Ask <a href=
            "http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/29/cities-livable-pittsburgh-lifestyle-real-estate-top-ten-jobs-crime-income.html">
            Forbes</a> and the <a href=
            "http://www.marketplace.org/topics/news-brief/its-official-pittsburgh-most-liveable-city-us">
            Economist</a>.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            What kinds of work do you do at Google Pittsburgh?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We have focused primarily on Ads, Ads-Shopping and infrastructure. Our Ads Quality team
            improves, expands and supports one of the world’s largest machine learning deployments.
            Our Ads UI team integrates advertiser input with Google's web corpus to create new,
            more useful ad formats. Our Ads-Shopping team, which developed Shopping, makes shopping
            more convenient and fun. That makes for some large engineering challenges, like
            building computer vision technology and mining all that’s for sale in the world. And
            our infrastructure team works on projects that make Google engineers around the world
            more productive. We make it easier to write stable, understandable code by providing
            the core libraries that engineers use every day, and make it easy for engineers to
            understand the behavior of code and debug problems that arise in the wild.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            So what kinds of skills are you looking for?
          </h4>
          <p>
            It varies a bit depending on what you ultimately work on, but generally, Pittsburgh
            Googlers have to be pretty versatile. We want computer scientists that love working at
            many levels of the software stack simultaneously. Having significant experience with
            C++ or Java coding and scripting is important to be able to build at scale, and we
            always look to add to our cache of experts in machine learning, data mining, computer
            vision and natural language processing. If you want to work on front-end products,
            you’ll need a deep understanding of Javascript, Java, HTML and CSS. And we also need
            people with experience developing beautiful user experiences for iOS and Android. For
            those working on our backend systems, we look for people with strong analytical and
            communications skills who have experience with aspects of running web services at
            scale. Typically, depth in either networking technologies or Unix system calls is a
            strong plus.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            What makes Pittsburgh different from other Google locations?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Design-wise, our office includes a gorgeous deck overlooking the city, a giant hammock
            we call “the trapeze net” and more than a few nods to our location’s industrial past,
            including a faded Google logo on the brick wall in reception, a conference room inside
            a chimney and murals of a railroad bridge and the city skyline. We have a music room, a
            pool table, a foosball table and vintage pinball machines. We plan monthly social
            excursions to do things like visit the local observatory or go ice skating, and are
            seriously into board games. And we still have the very first snack we purchased for our
            micro-kitchen, a cereal bar in the original wrapper. Oh, and we have an ongoing
            friendly rivalry with Google Cambridge.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            Are there any notable Pittsburgh Googlers?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Lots. Our site director, Andrew Moore, a Google VP and former Carnegie Mellon professor
            of computer science and robotics, is known for <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=handbook+of+biosurveillance&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=1358713279726794961&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B4pXT-S0COTu0gHwtaS8Dw&amp;ved=0CHYQ8wIwCA">
            his work</a> in areas like artificial intelligence data mining and <a href=
            "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1143844">machine learning</a>. Software engineer
            Peter Dibble wrote or co-wrote The Real-Time Specification for Java and RTSJ Platform
            Programming, as well as several books on OS-9. And software engineer Sam Harbison wrote
            or co-wrote C: A Reference Manual, Modula-3 and C.mmp/Hydra: An Experimental Computer
            System. And that’s just to name a few.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            How does Google Pittsburgh work with the local community?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We have an especially deep relationship with Carnegie Mellon (CMU), co-hosting seminars
            with the university, running shuttle buses to CMU for Googlers teaching or
            participating in events on campus and hosting CMU students in our office a couple of
            times a month. CMU students got pretty heavily involved in developing Sky Map once it
            was an open source project. We also do <a href=
            "https://plus.google.com/u/1/103266364845729488839/posts?gpsrc=hpjob">outreach to K-12
            students</a> in the community, bringing students into the office and hosting a weeklong
            Women in Engineering program for girls who want to get into computer science. For
            GoogleServe, we teach at local <a href=
            "https://plus.google.com/u/1/105912973864602608032/posts?gpsrc=hpjob">nonprofits</a> as
            well as work with local Girl and Boy Scout troops to beautify public spaces. And we
            host local developers for a live, interactive stream of Google I/O.
