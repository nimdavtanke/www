              Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct
            </h2>
            <p>
              Google Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Google”) are committed to ensuring
              that working conditions in its operations and in its supply chains are safe, that all
              workers are treated with respect and dignity and that business operations are
              environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. To that end, Google developed
              the following requirements for its suppliers (each a “Supplier”) based on the
              Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition Code of Conduct (“EICC”) and international
              standards such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
              and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as Google’s values.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will assess a Supplier’s commitment to compliance with these requirements when
              making sourcing and procurement decisions. Our goal is to work with Supplier to
              improve conditions through communications, training, monitoring and follow-up
              assessments. However, failure to comply with these requirements may result in
              termination of the relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supplier must in all of its activities follow the laws, rules and regulations of the
              countries in which it operates In addition, Supplier will comply with this Supplier
              Code of Conduct (the “Supplier Code”) and require compliance with these requirements
              in their agreements with their suppliers, service providers, contractors and
              subcontractors (collectively, their “Supply Chain”). If a contract between Google and
              a Supplier contains stricter or more detailed requirements than this Supplier Code,
              then we expect Supplier to meet those stricter or more detailed contractual
              requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>
              The Supplier Code of Conduct:
            </h3>
            <ol type="A">
              <li>
                <strong>LABOR</strong>
                <p>
                  Google is committed to upholding the human rights of workers and to treating them
                  with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. This
                  applies to all workers, including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct
                  employees and any other type of worker.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The labor standards are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Freely Chosen Employment; Anti-Human Trafficking</strong>
                    <p>
                      Supplier will not use or permit any form of forced, bonded (including debt
                      bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, sex trafficking,
                      slavery or trafficking of people in any stage of its manufacturing. This
                      includes transporting, harboring, recruiting, transferring or receiving any
                      person by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction or fraud for the
                      purpose of exploitation. All work must be voluntary and all workers,
                      including student interns, must be free to leave work at any time or
                      terminate their employment without reprisal. Workers will not be required to
                      surrender any government-issued identification, passports, or work permits as
                      a condition of employment. Excessive fees are unacceptable and Supplier will
                      disclose all fees charged to workers.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Child Labor Avoidance; Student Interns</strong>
                    <p>
                      Supplier will not use child labor in any stage of its manufacturing. The term
                      “child” refers to any person under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the
                      country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or
                      under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest.
                      Supplier may use legitimate, voluntary workplace apprenticeship programs,
                      such as student internships, as long as they comply with all laws and
                      regulations. Workers under the age of 18 will not perform work that is likely
                      to jeopardize their health, safety or well-being.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Working Hours</strong>
                    <p>
                      Supplier’s workweeks will not exceed the maximum set by local law. Further,
                      Supplier’s workweek should not be more than 60 hours per week, including
                      overtime, except in emergency or unusual situations. Workers must receive at
                      least one day off per seven-day week.

                    <strong>Wages and Benefits</strong>
                    <p>
                      Compensation paid to workers must comply with all applicable wage laws,
                      including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours and legally
                      mandated benefits. Supplier will compensate workers for overtime consistent
                      with applicable local law. Supplier will not permit deductions from wages as
                      a disciplinary measure. Supplier will provide workers with the basis on which
                      workers are paid via pay stub or similar documentation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Supplier will not tolerate harsh and inhumane treatment, including any sexual
                      harassment, sexual abuse, corporal punishment, mental or physical coercion or
                      verbal abuse of workers, including the threat of any such treatment. Supplier
                      will clearly define and communicate to workers the disciplinary policies and
                      procedures in support of these requirements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Supplier will be committed to a workforce free of harassment and unlawful
                      discrimination. Supplier will not engage in discrimination based on race,
                      color, age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, caste, disability,
                      pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership or marital
                      status, in hiring and employment practices such as promotions, rewards and
                      access to training. In addition, Supplier will not subject workers or
                      potential workers to medical tests that could be used in a discriminatory
                      way.

                    <strong>Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining</strong>
                    <p>
                      Open communication and direct engagement between workers and management are
                      the most effective ways to resolve workplace and compensation issues.
                      Suppliers will respect the rights of workers to associate freely, bargain
                      collectively, join or not join labor unions, seek representation and join
                      workers’ councils in accordance with local laws. Supplier will permit workers
                      to openly communicate and share grievances with management about working
                      conditions and management practices without fear of reprisal, intimidation or
                      harassment.

                    <p>
                      All of Supplier’s employees, including migrant and foreign workers, must be

                <strong>HEALTH and SAFETY</strong>
                <p>
                  Supplier recognizes that in addition to minimizing the incidence of work-related
                  injury and illness, a safe and healthy work environment enhances the quality of
                  products and services, consistency of production and worker retention and morale.
                  Supplier also recognizes that ongoing worker input and education is essential to
                  identifying and solving health and safety issues in the workplace.
                </p>
                <p>

                      OHSAS 18001 or equivalent. The Health &amp; Safety Management System will be
                      implemented and functioning. Third-party registration is strongly recommended
                      but not required unless requested by Google.

                      sound exposure and fall hazards) through proper design, engineering and
                      administrative controls, preventative maintenance and safe work procedures
                      and ongoing safety training. Where hazards cannot be adequately controlled by
                      these means, Supplier will provide workers with appropriate, well-maintained,
                      personal protective equipment. Workers will not be disciplined for raising
                      safety concerns.

                      and report occupational injury and illness, including provisions to encourage
                      worker reporting, classify and record injury and illness cases, provide
                      necessary medical treatment, investigate cases and implement corrective

                      administrative controls to control overexposures. When Supplier cannot
                      adequately control these hazards by such means, Supplier will protect worker
                      health by appropriate personal protective equipment programs.

                    <strong>Supplier Responsibility</strong>
                    <p>
                      A process to communicate Supplier Code requirements to the Supply Chain and
                      to monitor Supply Chain compliance to the Supplier Code.

                <strong>ONGOING ASSESSMENTS, MONITORING AND CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT</strong>
                <p>
                  If requested by Google, Supplier will provide additional information to ensure
                  adherence to this Supplier Code. Requests may include, among other things,
                  information on social and environmental practices, social and environmental
                  self-assessments, product content details, environmental metrics (e.g.,
                  greenhouse gas emissions, water use, water quality data), social metrics (e.g.,
                  working hour data, wage information, injury rates), management systems
                  certifications, etc. Monitoring and ongoing resolution of findings are critical
                  for advancing social and environmental responsibility, so Supplier will cooperate
                  with announced or unannounced formal assessments and audits by Google and its
                  agents (who have agreed to obligations of confidentiality similar to those agreed
                  between Supplier and Google).
