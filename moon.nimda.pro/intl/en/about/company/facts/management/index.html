                to more than 200 employees and profitability. From 2001 to 2011, Larry was
                president of products.

                Silicon Valley startup to a global leader in technology. As executive chairman, he
                is responsible for the external matters of Google: building partnerships and
                broader business relationships, government outreach and technology thought
                leadership, as well as advising the CEO and senior leadership on business and
                policy issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 2001-2011, Eric served as Google’s chief executive officer, overseeing the
                company’s technical and business strategy alongside founders Sergey Brin and Larry
                Page. Under his leadership, Google dramatically scaled its infrastructure and
                diversified its product offerings while maintaining a strong culture of innovation.

                of directors and the following year he joined the board of The Economist. In 2013,
                Eric and Jared Cohen co-authored The New York Times bestselling book, <em>The New
                Digital Age: Transforming Nations, Businesses, and Our Lives</em>. In September
                2014, Eric published his second New York Times best seller, <em>How Google
                Works</em>, which he and Jonathan Rosenberg co-authored with Alan Eagle.
