          Responsible Sourcing of Conflict Minerals
        </h1>
        <h2>
          Google's Conflict Minerals Policy
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Background
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many of our products, like virtually all consumer electronics, contain various metals,
          including tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (commonly referred to as “3TG”), which
          originate in mines around the world. The 3TG metals have become known as “conflict
          minerals” because much of it is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”)
          and adjoining countries (together, with the DRC, the “Covered Countries”) where a
          decades-long civil war is being waged. This conflict has been exacerbated by various
          groups fighting to control mines and transit routes used in the trade of these minerals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank
          Act”) requires public companies to file annual reports with the U.S. Securities and
          Exchange Commission beginning in May 2014, disclosing whether or not they are using 3TG
          originating from the Covered Countries. A potential, but unintended, consequence of the
          Dodd-Frank Act is a widespread withdrawal from trade with the Covered Countries by U.S.
          companies.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Our Commitment
        </h3>
        <p>
          Google believes it is essential to establish validated, conflict-free sources of 3TG
          within the Covered Countries so that these minerals can be procured in a way that
          contributes to economic growth and development in the regions. We believe a widespread
          withdrawal from trade with the Covered Countries by US companies should be avoided. We
          aim to partner with governmental organizations, industry groups and non-governmental
          organizations to achieve a workable solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect our suppliers to source only from certified conflict-free smelters, such as
          those audited by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative’s <a href=
          "http://www.conflictfreesourcing.org/conflict-free-smelter-program/">Conflict-Free
          Smelter Program</a>. If we determine that our expectation is not met, Google will work
          with the supplier and the industry to enable conflict-free sourcing. Google advises its
          suppliers to take similar measures with their own sub‐suppliers to ensure alignment and
          traceability throughout the supply chain and back to the smelter. Under the <a href=
          "http://www.google.com/about/company/responsible-manufacturing.html">Google Supplier Code
          of Conduct</a>, we expect our suppliers to perform due diligence on the source and chain
          of custody of minerals used in the manufacturing of products they supply to Google.
          Suppliers’ due diligence measures should be available to us upon request.

          Google’s Partnerships
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are partnering with governmental organizations, industry groups and non-governmental
          organizations to further conflict-free initiatives. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google has been a member of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative since 2013 (member
          ID: GOOG) and has supported its flagship program, the <a href=
          "http://www.conflictfreesourcing.org/conflict-free-smelter-program/" target=
          "_blank">Conflict-Free Smelter Program</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Google has contributed to the Initial Audit Fund, a program managed by the
          Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative, which offers smelters an incentive for participating
          in the Conflict-Free Smelter Program by fully paying for the costs of their initial audit
          when they are determined to be compliant.
          </li>
          <li>In 2014, Google joined other companies supporting the <a href=
          "http://solutions-network.org/site-solutionsforhope/" target="_blank">Solutions for Hope
          Gold</a> initiative. “Solutions for Hope is a platform that supports companies, civil
          society organizations, and governments working together to responsibly source minerals
          from regions experiencing conflict where market access is limited by opaque supply
          chains.” - Solutions for Hope website
