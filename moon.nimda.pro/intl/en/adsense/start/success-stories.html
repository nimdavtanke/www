              "After publishing a number of tech books, I launched askdavetaylor.com back in 2002
              as a more efficient way of responding to questions emailed to me by readers. The site
              has grown enormously in the last 10 years – it now welcomes 1 million unique visitors
              a month, and answers queries on a very wide range of tech issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              I signed up for AdSense in 2003, and within two months, the revenue from the program
              was enough to pay my hosting bill in full. By the third month, the revenue covered my
              monthly mortgage repayment! That's when I realized the website could be a viable
              business in itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the money from AdSense, I was able to quit my job in 2003 and concentrate<br>
              entirely on the website. I'm still adding new articles every day, and have been happy
              to see AdSense reporting and targeting options become more sophisticated over the
              years. AdSense has ultimately allowed me to focus on the important things in life –
              like spending more time with my kids."

              “http://www.HistoryOrb.com is an ‘on this day in history’ website. I started in 2000
              with historical events, famous birthdays and deaths and have added more content over
              time. We now have 200,000 entries and the site is the biggest of its kind. In March
              2013, we had over one million unique visitors. I first heard about AdSense in an
              article I read while at university and was immediately interested. Before AdSense,
              online ads were clunky and unappealing – they looked bad and weren’t effective. So
              AdSense was a great match for us from the start.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have lots of content, so we get highly targeted ads with AdSense. Our main goal is
              to provide better historical information on the net. We’ve reinvested a lot of the
              money from AdSense on content, and the more revenue we’ve made, the better the
              website has become for our users. We’ve also added a Spanish language site and have
              just finished creating a mobile version of our English site.
            </p>
            <p>
              AdSense has allowed me to quit my job as an IT consultant and work full-time on the
              site. I spent the two last years travelling in South America and working remotely.
              Now my friends back in New Zealand tell me I’m ‘living the dream’.”

              “My site started as a database of names and meanings for a software program that I
              had developed with my mother. When the internet became available for public use, we
              put that database online and in 1996 it became BabyNames.com. The site was the first
              site of its kind, and now gets 1.6 million unique visitors per month. There are four
              other partners – my mom and three sisters – as well as a hired staff. We first
              started with AdSense to help us pay our hosting costs, but never imagined it would
              become a viable business. I went full-time with BabyNames.com in 2006, and in one
              year, doubled our income.<br>
              <br>
              AdSense changed the way we did business and it’s been nothing but a positive
              experience for us. With Google you get a partner who is just as interested in growing
              your business as you are. You get more than income – you get expertise. It’s opened
              our minds to what other publishers are doing. We’ve now expanded to a site for pet
              names and are working on a new site for character names, aimed at authors. And these
              days, we get asked to speak on national broadcast media about celebrities and their
              baby names. We’ve become the de facto experts in the field!”

              “www.mooseyscountrygarden.com started out as a mother’s day present from me to my
              mum, Moosey, in 1997. It’s grown into a fully-fledged gardening website focused on
              her garden, with up to 10,000 visits a day. I signed up for AdSense back in 2003 to
              show her we could generate revenue in a tasteful way. We decided we’d spend the
              income on the garden, so it could directly help her improve what she was doing on the
              site.
            </p>
            <p>
              When revenue really started to grow, mum was able to retire from teaching to become a
              professional garden writer. She loves connecting with people, and AdSense has allowed
              her to share her garden with the world. AdSense takes the tech worries away so she
              can concentrate on her garden. The targeting is also streets ahead, with both
              contextual and behavioural ads getting better and better. AdSense gives us 100 per
              cent of our advertising revenue, which gets invested into the garden and even
              technology -- we’ve invested in a prototype of a solar powered wireless web cam, and
              can’t wait to try it!”

              “We started www.golisbon.com back in 2004 as the sister site to www.gomadrid.com. It
              offers travel tips and advice for tourists visiting Lisbon. We now have five times
              the number of visitors than when we started out. We get around 100,000 unique
              visitors per month and the site has become much more authoritative. We heard about
              AdSense on an online forum for webmasters in 2003 and signed up immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              AdSense has given us a constant, reliable income stream. It accounts for 100 per cent
              of our advertising revenue and has allowed us to reinvest time and money on getting
              things going with the site. Rich media ads have been a welcome addition and we use
              them to great effect. While we’re always looking to grow and provide new information
              for our customers, we’ve always stuck with AdSense. It just works. Lisbon may be a
              city that is constantly changing, but AdSense remains a stable product providing a
              stable income.”

              “I launched www.sanfranciscochinatown.com in 2002. It’s a guide to Chinatown for
              locals and tourists, including information about events, history and points of
              interest. Traffic to the site varies, but peak season is Chinese New Year, when we
              get over 100,000 unique visitors. Initially, most of our revenue came from sources
              such as partnerships and affiliate programs, so we only started using AdSense as a
              test, to see what would happen. It proved a great success, and actually generated
              more revenue than our other channels.<br>
              <br>
              The revenue we get means we don’t have to think about charging users and it has
              enabled us to diversify and expand into new areas. A few years ago, we redesigned the
              site and began using DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP). This tripled our AdSense
              income, which now accounts for almost 90 percent of our ad revenue. Moving AdSense
              and DFP into one single tool has made managing ads easier and saved us loads of time.
              I hope to make www.sanfrancisochinatown.com my full-time job and replicate the
              physical world of Chinatown online. We want to help shop owners promote their stores
              and even sell products online as many don’t have websites of their own.”

              35,000 people every day ask questions. AdSense is extremely important to our
              business. People who come to our site are looking for answers to questions that are
              typically very specific. AdSense presents content that's interesting, relevant and
              appropriate for our visitors, serving ads that enhance the time the users spend on
              our site. From the publisher perspective, I'm actually earning revenue in a way that

            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past ten years, I've seen AdSense evolve to meet new challenges. Take
              mobile, for example: Users are increasingly using their smartphones and tablets to
              search for information. It's very important for us to provide them with a great
              experience. AdSense has enabled us to have a robust and profitable mobile business
              that's growing quickly year on year, and to make big bets moving forward through ads
              that add to our users' experience. AdSense provides a bedrock monetization solution
              for your site, and if your site is growing, then AdSense will grow with you. For our
              business, there’s nothing as good as AdSense.”

              amount of people I could reach. The new site allowed me to experiment with free
              content so I could reach a much larger audience. Revenue from AdSense since 2003 has
              allowed me to invest time in the site – I can put things up for free, see what people
              like and move in that direction.

              AdSense is a dependable source of extra income each month, and I can now reach more
              people in more countries. AdSense revenue from YouTube allows me to make regular
              videos about learning Japanese, and I’ve created sites for other languages, like
              Korean, Thai and Chinese. The Thai government has just put my software on 800,000
              tablets, and I now have projects in Tanzania and India. My goal is for every subject
              in every country to be taught the ‘genki’ way!”

              homeschoolers find resources online. Since then, thehomeschoolmom.com has grown
              dramatically. We’ve had three million unique visitors in the past five years alone,

              up. When I started playing around with the format and placement of ad units, I was

              much easier for me. The less time I have to spend on tweaking ads, the more time I
              can spend on great content. I’m very excited about an upcoming major redesign project
              for the site. Of course, we’ll be keeping AdSense performance in mind as we make

              the site in 1996, purely as a hobby. Japan really interested me, but I didn’t like
              the way it was being portrayed in the media. So I started my own site, free of
              stereotypes – just Japan as it is. When I lost my job in 2001, I got the motivation
              to turn the site into a full-time business. After moving to Japan in 2003 and still
              struggling, I gave AdSense a try, and it really helped my business take a big step
              forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was amazed at how well it performed compared to other ad networks. The income has
              allowed me to hire extra people, and we now register about one million unique
              visitors a month. Over time, AdSense has become easier to use, and the new tools to
              control ads and ad types have been great. Revenue from AdSense has allowed me to
              concentrate fully on developing the travel section of the site. And consequently it’s
              grown from just a few pages into the 1,000-page guide it is today!”

              “I started www.psychcentral.com, one of the first mental health websites to be run by
              a mental health professional. Back in 2003, I was still running the site on the side
              with my team. We looked at several solutions, but heard AdSense was reliable and
              could really deliver on cost per impression. It has been fundamental to growing our
              business. We had somewhere around 200,000 visitors a month back then – now it’s
              nearly 4 million.
            </p>
            <p>
              AdSense played an important part in the decision to go full-time with the site in
              2006. It was about having a reliable, stable income stream – knowing that if we
              delivered X number of page views, we would get Y revenue. We’ve always liked that it
              gives you a clear dashboard, and full control of the ads shown. We get a monthly
              overview of performance and can see which parts of the site are performing better
              than others. Now, we’re looking at doing more with mobile to help us continue the 20
              percent year-over-year growth we’ve enjoyed over the last few years.”

              “We launched www.geekzone.co.nz in 2003 to be a repository of ideas. In those days it
              was hard to share content, and we started by posting things we had found around the
              Internet. We later set up a forum so other people could share news and discuss
              issues, and now we call the site a technology community. It serves 500,000 unique
              visitors a month. We signed up for AdSense in 2003 as we were keen to find an
              advertising solution to pay our hosting bills. Back then we had no time to sell
              advertising, and New Zealand was a very small market where it was difficult to
              attract advertisers. AdSense took care of both of those issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              AdSense has proved to be very effective. I left my day job in 2007 because income was
              coming through and it made financial sense. As the site grew, we started partnering
              with local advertisers and running their campaigns together with AdSense through
              Google’s DoubleClick for Publishers. The integration between AdSense and DFP into a
              single tool has made our lives much easier. AdSense has been a really reliable and
              valuable revenue stream, and even today we couldn’t run the site without it. It gave
              me the safety net I needed to change my career and go into publishing full-time.”

              “www.cairnsdining.com is a guide to restaurants in Cairns and hosts user-generated
              reviews. It’s one of ten sites we run about travel in Queensland, and it’s definitely
              the biggest. We launched it in 2003, and it was the first of its kind at the time.
              Back then there were two of us – now there are 15 members of staff. We’ve expanded
              with the growth of the restaurant scene, and we get around 30,000 unique visitors to
              the site a month. In truth, we started out with AdSense to earn just a little bit of
              money – enough for some Friday-night drinks. But it’s become much more
              significant.<br>
              <br>
              AdSense provides an assured income so we can continue creating websites and invest in
              producing niche content. It brings in 100 percent of our ad revenue. Custom channels
              have allowed us to track each site and placement more precisely, so we’ve been able
              to get much more out of it. Our aim is to create a series of Australia-wide,
              attraction-based sites. Most of our current sites focus on Queensland – we want to go
              national!”
