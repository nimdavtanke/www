    <h2>
      Dr. Anita Borg (1949–2003)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anita Borg believed that technology affects all aspects of our economic, political, social
      and personal lives. A technology rebel with a cause, in her life she fought tirelessly to
      ensure that technology’s impact would be a positive one. It was this vision that inspired
      Anita in 1997 to found the Institute for Women and Technology. Today this organization
      continues on her legacy and bears her name, The Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology
      (<a href="http://www.anitaborg.org">www.anitaborg.org</a>).

      <p>
        Her capacity to mix technical expertise and a relentless vision inspired, motivated and
        moved women to embrace technology instead of avoiding or ignoring it. She has touched and
        changed the lives of countless women in the computing fields and beyond. She is responsible
        for including women in the technological revolution – not as bystanders, but as active
        participants and leaders. In 1987, prior to founding the Institute, Anita began an email
        online community called Systers which today has 3,000 members from all over the world. In
        1994, Anita co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference. The
        Grace Hopper Celebration has grown to become the largest gathering of women in computing in
        the world. The Anita Borg Institute is the umbrella organization for both of these ongoing
        programs as well as the Virtual Development Center, TechLeaders and a host of other dynamic
        partnerships and collaborations that embrace Anita’s ongoing vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        During her life, Anita’s commitment to her vision and expertise in the field gained her
        significant recognition. In 1999 President Clinton appointed her to the Commission on the
        Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology. In 2002, she
        received the Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy, and Employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born Anita Borg Naffz on January 17th, 1949 in Chicago, Illinois, she grew up in Palatine,
        Illinois, Kaneohe, Hawaii, and Mukilteo, Washington. Anita found her way to a computer
        keyboard in her mid-20s. She received a Ph.D. in computer science from the Courant
        Institute at New York University in 1981. She then embarked on a brilliant research career
        for some of industry’s commercial giants including, Nixdorf, Digital/Compaq’s Western
        Research Lab and Xerox PARC.

      The Scholarship
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Anita Borg devoted her adult life to revolutionizing the way we think about technology
      and dismantling barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and
      technology fields. Her combination of technical expertise and fearless vision continues to
      inspire and motivate countless women to become active participants and leaders in creating
      technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her honor, Google is proud to honor Anita’s memory and support women in technology with
      the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship. Google hopes to encourage women to excel in
      computing and technology and become active role models and leaders in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google Anita Borg Scholarship recipients will each receive a financial award for the academic
      year. A group of female undergraduate and graduate students will be chosen from the applicant
      pool, and scholarships will be awarded based on the strength of each candidate’s academic
      background and demonstrated leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, all scholarship recipients and finalists will be invited to attend a retreat at
      Google. We know how important a supportive peer network can be for a student’s success. The
      retreat will include workshops, speakers, panelists, breakout sessions and social activities
      scheduled over a couple of days.
